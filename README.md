# Sotify_Clone

1. Built a Soptify clone with the help of HTML, CSS and Java script.
2. Created a responsive web design that can respond to the user's behaviour and environment based on screen size.
3. Added the functionality that takes songs from the list that we created, and we can add songs to the audio player. There is also a play and pause option available with the additional feature of a seek bar.
